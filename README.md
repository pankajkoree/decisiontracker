## What achieved

1.  [Landing page](https://decisiontracker.vercel.app/) for better approach of designing the website
    <br>
    -> Landing page

    ![Landing Page](./public/landing%20page.png)
    <br>
    in the landing page, provided two routes for (A) Decision History (B) Create New Decision
    <br>

    as mentioned in the task
    <br>
    (A) Decision History - if some already decisions have been made
    <br>
    In decision history, there is two UI, as one before having some decision already listed and other when some decision have been added

        -> Without decisions list

        -> With decisions list

    ![Wit Decisions List](./public/decision%20history%20page%20when%20decisions%20are%20there.png)

       <br>
       (B) Create New Decision - to add new decision and i made it in two part as
       <br>
       -> Create Decision

    ![Create decision](./public/decision%20history%20page%20when%20no%20decisions%20are%20there.png)
    <br>
    (i) Pending or not marked - which have title as required attribute and pros and cons as optional
    <br>
    -> Before marked or completed
    ![Before marked ](./public/before%20decisiom%20marked.png)
    <br>
    (ii) Completed or marked - which have final choice and reason for choice as required and is this good decision as optional
    <br>
    -> After marked or completed
    ![After marked ](./public/after%20decisiom%20marked.png)

## What could be done further

(A) Authentication could be implemented - for a specific user, it could have registration process to use
<br>
I tried to implement authentication process using localStorage but due to overburdening it, i just made the UI and work flow part, but further cut it out from the process, as it doesn't affect current process even if there is no authentication

(B) Manual filter or sorting - allowing users to manually sort or filter out the decisions, based on date, or based on priority.

(C) Editable decision - allowing users to be able to update the decision or even if deleting option for particular decisions.
